# Summary

After a couple weeks using my Ender3 I quickly realized why there are so many filament guide accessories.  The filament entering the feed gear housing was quickly cutting its way through the stock guide.  After a lot of searching for a guide with a 3D printed bearing that would work smoothly I gave up and designed my own using a re-mix of Emmett's Gear Bearing.  This bearing is by far the smoothest running 3D printed bearing I have found and turns out it works great with an added v-groove as a filament guide.  If you have just started using an Ender3 printer give this thing a try.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Creality
Printer: Ender 3
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: Yes
Resolution: .15mm
Infill: 20-30%

Notes: 
The bearing must be printed "WITHOUT" support or it will not work.  Supports are required for the support arm. 

# Post-Printing

## Assemble and print!

1. Print all three parts
2. Remove support material from the support arm
3. Snap the bearing onto the support arm hex shaft
4. Slide the assembled support arm into position on your Ender3 Z-axis carriage
5. Use the 5mm lock pin to secure the bottom of the support arm to the existing hole in the carriage next to the Z-Axis drive motor.
